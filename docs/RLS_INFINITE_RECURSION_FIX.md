# RLS Infinite Recursion Fix

## üö® **Problem Identified**

The test results show:
```
‚ùå Organizations table error: infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "employees"
‚ùå Employees table error: infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "employees"
```

This happens when RLS policies reference each other in a circular way, causing infinite loops.

## üîß **Solution**

I've created a final fix migration that resolves the infinite recursion issue.

### **Step 1: Run the Final Fix Migration**

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Create a new query
4. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/012_final_rls_fix.sql`
5. Run the query

### **Step 2: Test the Fix**

1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/auth-test`
2. Click "Run Authentication Tests"
3. You should now see:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Organizations table accessible. Found X organizations
   ‚úÖ Employees table accessible. Found X employees
   ```

### **Step 3: Test Registration**

1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/register`
2. Try registering a new organization
3. Should work without infinite recursion errors

## üîç **What the Fix Does**

### **Removes Circular References**
- Drops all existing policies that cause recursion
- Creates simple, direct policies without circular dependencies

### **Uses Security Definer Function**
- Creates `get_user_organization_id()` function to safely get organization data
- Avoids recursion by using a separate function

### **Simplified Policies**
- Organizations: Only creator can insert/view/update
- Employees: Only user can view/update their own record
- Registration: Allows creation during signup process

## üìã **Expected Results After Fix**

### **Auth Test Page Should Show:**
```
‚úÖ Session check passed. Current user: None
‚úÖ Organizations table accessible. Found X organizations
‚úÖ Employees table accessible. Found X employees
‚ö†Ô∏è No authenticated user - skipping RLS test
‚úÖ VITE_SUPABASE_URL configured: https://...
‚úÖ VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY configured: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...
```

### **Registration Should Work:**
- No infinite recursion errors
- No 401 Unauthorized errors
- Successful organization and employee creation
- Redirect to dashboard

## üö® **If Still Having Issues**

### **Check Policy Status**
Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('organizations', 'employees')
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
```

### **Check Function Exists**
```sql
SELECT proname, prosrc 
FROM pg_proc 
WHERE proname = 'get_user_organization_id';
```

### **Test Simple Query**
```sql
SELECT id, name, type FROM organizations LIMIT 1;
SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM employees LIMIT 1;
```

## ‚úÖ **Success Indicators**

The fix is working when:
- ‚úÖ Auth test page shows no infinite recursion errors
- ‚úÖ Organizations and employees tables are accessible
- ‚úÖ Registration works without errors
- ‚úÖ Login works and loads user data
- ‚úÖ Dashboard displays organization information

The infinite recursion issue should be completely resolved! üöÄ
