# Registration Error Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Organization Creation Error
**Error**: `null value in column "contact_email" of relation "organizations" violates not-null constraint`

**Root Cause**: The `contact_email` field is required in the organizations table but wasn't being provided during registration.

**Fix**: Added `contact_email: formData.email` to the organization creation data.

### 2. Employee Fetch Error During Registration
**Error**: `Cannot coerce the result to a single JSON object` (PGRST116)

**Root Cause**: The AuthContext tries to fetch employee data immediately after user creation, but the employee record doesn't exist yet during the registration process.

**Fix**: Added better error handling to recognize this as an expected state during registration.

## Changes Made

### 1. RegisterPage.tsx
```typescript
// Added required contact_email field
const { data: orgData, error: orgError } = await supabase
  .from('organizations')
  .insert({
    name: formData.organizationName,
    type: formData.organizationType,
    contact_email: formData.email, // âœ… Added this required field
    contact_phone: formData.contactPhone || null,
    website: formData.website || null,
    address: formData.address || null,
    description: formData.description || null,
    status: 'pending',
  })
  .select()
  .single();
```

### 2. AuthContext.tsx
```typescript
// Better error handling for registration process
if (error) {
  console.error('Employee fetch error:', error);
  // If it's a "no rows" error, that's expected during registration
  if (error.code === 'PGRST116') {
    console.log('No employee record found yet - user may be in registration process');
  }
  // Don't fail - just set loading to false
  setLoading(false);
  return;
}
```

## Test the Fix

### 1. Try Registration Again
1. **Fill out the registration form** completely
2. **Click "Create Organization"**
3. **Check for success message** (green)
4. **Check console logs** for successful organization creation

### 2. Expected Results
- âœ… **No more "contact_email" error**
- âœ… **Organization created successfully**
- âœ… **Employee record created successfully**
- âœ… **Success message appears**
- âœ… **Form clears after success**

### 3. After Email Confirmation
1. **Check email** for confirmation link
2. **Click confirmation link**
3. **Login** with the created account
4. **Dashboard should load** properly (no "Account Setup Required")

## Database Schema Reference

The organizations table requires:
- `name` (VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL)
- `type` (organization_type NOT NULL)
- `contact_email` (VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL) âœ… **This was missing**
- `status` (organization_status DEFAULT 'pending')

## Troubleshooting

### If you still get errors:

1. **Check console logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify all required fields** are filled in the form
3. **Check if email is unique** (not already used)
4. **Apply RLS migrations** if not done already:
   - `027_fix_organization_insert_policy.sql`
   - `028_fix_employee_rls_for_auth.sql`

### Common Issues:
- **Email already exists**: Try with a different email
- **Organization name required**: Make sure to fill this field
- **RLS policy errors**: Apply the RLS migrations

The registration should now work properly! ðŸŽ‰
