# Admin Organization View/Edit Fix

## Issue
In the 'Organization Management' screen, clicking on "View" or "Edit" buttons was redirecting to the Admin Dashboard instead of showing organization details or edit forms.

## Root Cause
The AdminOrganizationsPage was trying to navigate to routes that didn't exist:
- `/admin/organizations/${org.id}` (View)
- `/admin/organizations/${org.id}/edit` (Edit)

These routes were not defined in App.tsx, causing the router to fall back to a default route.

## Solution

### 1. Created Missing Pages

#### AdminOrganizationDetailsPage (`/admin/organizations/:organizationId`)
- **Features**:
  - Display complete organization information
  - Show organization statistics (employees, projects, leads)
  - Status management (activate/suspend)
  - Quick actions to view projects, leads, and edit
  - Proper error handling and loading states

#### AdminOrganizationEditPage (`/admin/organizations/:organizationId/edit`)
- **Features**:
  - Form to edit organization details
  - Validation for required fields
  - Update name, type, status, contact info, and address
  - Save changes with proper error handling
  - Cancel functionality to return to details

### 2. Enhanced AdminService

Added `updateOrganization` method to handle full organization updates:
```typescript
async updateOrganization(organizationId: string, updates: {
  name?: string;
  type?: 'developer' | 'agent';
  status?: 'active' | 'pending' | 'suspended';
  contact_email?: string;
  contact_phone?: string;
  address?: string;
}): Promise<void>
```

### 3. Added Routes to App.tsx

```typescript
<Route 
  path="/admin/organizations/:organizationId" 
  element={user ? <AdminOrganizationDetailsPage /> : <Navigate to="/login" replace />} 
/>
<Route 
  path="/admin/organizations/:organizationId/edit" 
  element={user ? <AdminOrganizationEditPage /> : <Navigate to="/login" replace />} 
/>
```

## Files Modified

### New Files Created:
- `src/pages/AdminOrganizationDetailsPage.tsx`
- `src/pages/AdminOrganizationEditPage.tsx`

### Files Modified:
- `src/App.tsx` - Added new routes
- `src/services/adminService.ts` - Added updateOrganization method
