# Disable RLS for Registration

## üö® **Current Issue**

The RLS policies are still blocking organization creation despite multiple attempts to fix them. The error persists:
```
new row violates row-level security policy for table "organizations"
```

## üîß **Solution: Temporarily Disable RLS**

Since the RLS policies are causing persistent issues, let's temporarily disable RLS to get registration working, then we can re-enable it later with proper policies.

### **Step 1: Run the RLS Disable Migration**

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Create a new query
4. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/017_disable_rls_completely.sql`
5. Run the query

### **Step 2: Verify RLS is Disabled**

After running the migration, you should see output like:
```
tablename     | rls_enabled | status
organizations | false       | DISABLED
employees     | false       | DISABLED

Policies on organizations:
(no rows)

Policies on employees:
(no rows)
```

### **Step 3: Test Registration**

1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/register`
2. Fill out the form with valid data:
   - **Email**: `dev@skye.com`
   - **Password**: `password123`
   - **Organization Name**: `Test Developer Corp`
   - **Organization Type**: `Developer`
   - **First Name**: `John`
   - **Last Name**: `Doe`
   - **Contact Phone**: `+1234567890`
   - **Address**: `123 Test Street`
   - **Website**: `https://test.com`
   - **Description**: `Test organization`

3. Click "Register Organization"
4. Should now work without any RLS policy violations

## üìã **Expected Results**

With RLS disabled:
- ‚úÖ No RLS policy violation errors
- ‚úÖ Organization created successfully
- ‚úÖ Employee created successfully
- ‚úÖ Redirect to dashboard
- ‚úÖ Dashboard displays data correctly

## üîí **Re-enable RLS Later (Optional)**

Once registration is working and you want to add security back, you can re-enable RLS with simple policies:

```sql
-- Re-enable RLS
ALTER TABLE organizations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE employees ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create simple policies
CREATE POLICY "org_insert_any" ON organizations FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);
CREATE POLICY "org_view_own" ON organizations FOR SELECT USING (created_by = auth.uid());
CREATE POLICY "org_update_own" ON organizations FOR UPDATE USING (created_by = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "emp_insert_any" ON employees FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);
CREATE POLICY "emp_view_own" ON employees FOR SELECT USING (user_id = auth.uid());
CREATE POLICY "emp_update_own" ON employees FOR UPDATE USING (user_id = auth.uid());
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

- **This is a temporary solution** to get registration working
- **RLS is disabled** - anyone can access the data
- **Use only for development/testing** - not for production
- **Re-enable RLS** when you're ready to add security back

## ‚úÖ **Success Indicators**

The fix is working when:
- ‚úÖ Migration runs without errors
- ‚úÖ RLS shows as DISABLED for both tables
- ‚úÖ No policies exist on either table
- ‚úÖ Registration form submits successfully
- ‚úÖ No RLS policy violation errors
- ‚úÖ Organization and employee records created
- ‚úÖ Redirect to dashboard works
- ‚úÖ Dashboard displays data correctly

The registration should work perfectly with RLS disabled! üöÄ
