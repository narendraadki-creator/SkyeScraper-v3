   - Permission and role checking utilities

3. **Auth Context** (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
   - Global user state management
   - Automatic session handling
   - Auth state change listeners

4. **Protected Routes** (`src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`)

   - Permission-based access control
   - Organization and employee status validation

5. **Authentication Pages**
   - **Registration Page** (`src/pages/RegisterPage.tsx`)
   - **Login Page** (`src/pages/LoginPage.tsx`)
   - **Dashboard Page** (`src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`)

6. **Routing System** (`src/App.tsx`)
   - React Router integration
   - Automatic redirects based on auth state
   - Protected route handling

## üß™ **Testing Instructions**

### **Prerequisites**

1. **Supabase Setup Required**:
   ```bash
   # Create .env file with your Supabase credentials
   cp env.example .env
   ```

2. **Update .env file**:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   ```

3. **Database Migrations**: Ensure all 8 migration files have been run in Supabase

### **Test 1: Organization Registration**

1. **Navigate to Registration**:
   - Go to `http://localhost:5173/register`
   - Should see organization registration form

2. **Fill Registration Form**:
   ```
   Personal Information:
   - First Name: John
   - Last Name: Doe
   - Email: john.doe@example.com
   - Password: password123
   - Confirm Password: password123

   Organization Information:
   - Organization Name: Acme Developers
   - Organization Type: Developer
   - Contact Phone: +1-555-0123
   - Website: https://acmedev.com
   - Address: 123 Main St, City, State
   - Description: Leading real estate developer
   ```

3. **Submit Registration**:
   - Click "Create Organization"
   - Should redirect to dashboard on success
   - Check browser console for any errors

4. **Verify Database**:
   - Check Supabase dashboard for new organization record
   - Check for new employee record with admin role
   - Verify user account in Supabase Auth

### **Test 2: Employee Login**

1. **Navigate to Login**:
   - Go to `http://localhost:5173/login`
   - Should see login form

2. **Login with Credentials**:
   ```
   Email: john.doe@example.com
   Password: password123
   ```

3. **Verify Login**:
   - Should redirect to dashboard
   - Should see organization and user information
   - Check browser console for errors

4. **Check JWT Token**:
   - Open browser DevTools > Application > Local Storage
   - Look for Supabase auth tokens
   - Verify token is present and valid

### **Test 3: Dashboard Access**

1. **Verify Dashboard Content**:
   - Should see welcome message with user's name
   - Should display organization information
   - Should show role-based badges (Developer/Agent)
   - Should display employee code

2. **Check Debug Information**:
   - Scroll down to see debug section
   - Verify all user, employee, and organization data is loaded
   - Check that permissions are properly set

3. **Test Sign Out**:
   - Click "Sign Out" button
   - Should redirect to login page
   - Should clear all auth data

### **Test 4: Protected Routes**

1. **Test Unauthenticated Access**:
   - Sign out and try to access `/dashboard`
   - Should redirect to login page
   - Should show "Access Denied" message

2. **Test Direct URL Access**:
   - While logged out, try `http://localhost:5173/dashboard`
   - Should automatically redirect to login

3. **Test Authentication Persistence**:
   - Login and refresh the page
   - Should stay logged in
   - Should maintain user state

### **Test 5: Role-Based Access**

1. **Create Different Organization Types**:
   - Register as Developer organization
   - Register as Agent organization
   - Verify different badges and theming

2. **Test Admin Permissions**:
   - Verify admin role is assigned to organization creator
   - Check permissions object in debug section
   - Should have all admin permissions

### **Test 6: Error Handling**

1. **Test Invalid Login**:
   - Try login with wrong password
   - Should show error message
   - Should not redirect

2. **Test Registration Validation**:
   - Try registration with invalid email
   - Try registration with mismatched passwords
   - Should show validation errors

3. **Test Network Errors**:
   - Disconnect internet and try login
   - Should handle gracefully with error message

## üîç **Verification Checklist**

- [ ] Organization record created in `organizations` table
- [ ] Employee record created in `employees` table with admin role
- [ ] User account created in Supabase Auth
- [ ] All foreign key relationships working
- [ ] RLS policies allowing access

### **Authentication Verification**
- [ ] JWT token stored in localStorage
- [ ] User session persists on page refresh
- [ ] Auth state updates correctly
- [ ] Sign out clears all auth data
- [ ] Protected routes work correctly

### **UI/UX Verification**
- [ ] Registration form validation works
- [ ] Login form validation works
- [ ] Loading states display correctly
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Success redirects work
- [ ] Role-based theming displays correctly

### **Security Verification**
- [ ] Passwords are not logged in console

- [ ] JWT tokens are properly managed
- [ ] Session timeout works correctly

## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

1. **"Failed to fetch" errors**:
   - Check Supabase URL and API key in .env
   - Verify Supabase project is active
   - Check network connectivity

2. **"Employee record not found"**:
   - Verify database migrations were run
   - Check RLS policies are enabled
   - Verify employee record was created

3. **"Organization not found"**:
   - Check organization was created during registration
   - Verify foreign key relationships
   - Check RLS policies for organizations table

4. **Redirect loops**:
   - Check auth state management
   - Verify route protection logic
   - Check for infinite re-renders

### **Debug Steps**

1. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Look for JavaScript errors
   - Check network requests to Supabase
   - Verify auth state changes

2. **Check Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Verify tables exist and have data
   - Check RLS policies are enabled
   - Verify auth users are created

3. **Check Local Storage**:
   - Verify Supabase auth tokens exist
   - Check token expiration
   - Clear storage and retry if needed

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

The authentication system is working correctly when:

- ‚úÖ Organization registration creates all required records
- ‚úÖ Employee login loads user, employee, and organization data
- ‚úÖ Dashboard displays correct information and role-based theming
- ‚úÖ Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users
- ‚úÖ Sign out clears all auth data and redirects to login
- ‚úÖ Auth state persists across page refreshes
- ‚úÖ No console errors during normal operation
- ‚úÖ JWT tokens are properly managed
- ‚úÖ RLS policies prevent unauthorized access

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

After successful authentication testing:

1. **Create Additional Pages**: Projects, Units, Leads management
2. **Implement CRUD Operations**: Full data management
3. **Add File Upload**: Document and image management
4. **Implement Notifications**: Real-time updates
5. **Add Analytics**: Dashboard metrics and reporting

The authentication foundation is now solid and ready for building the full SkyeScraper application! üéâ
